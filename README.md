## View the IG

### [Current build](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-udap-security-ig)

## Scope

The aim of this project is to expand upon the existing work by UDAP.org within the HL7 consensus process to produce a more complete set of implementation guides targeted at implementers of both client and server systems using FHIR for data exchange, standardizing how implementers integrate the UDAP profiles identified by the FAST Security Tiger Team into existing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect workflows.

## Pull Requests

Please make all pull requests against the 'main' branch only. The 'master' branch is a copy of the 'main' branch and only exists because HL7's current IG build framework requires a branch with this name to be present in order to work properly. Once the build framework issue is resolved, the 'master' branch will be removed.
